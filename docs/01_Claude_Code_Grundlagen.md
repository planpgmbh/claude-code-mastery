# Claude Code Workflow Grundlagen

## Core Workflow Commands

### Essential Development Commands
```bash
# Project Initialization
/rsi                    # Read, Setup, Initialize - Load all key project files
/context-prime         # Load comprehensive project understanding
/load-llms-txt        # Import project-specific terminology and config

# Development Workflow
/tdd                  # Test-Driven Development with Red-Green-Refactor
/commit               # Create Conventional Commits with appropriate emojis
/create-pr           # Automate entire Pull Request workflow
/fix-github-issue    # Analyze and resolve GitHub Issues systematically

# Code Analysis
/code_analysis      # Deep code inspection with optimization suggestions
/cost               # Token usage optimization
/compact            # Minimize context for performance
/clear              # Clear context when switching tasks
```

## CLAUDE.md Best Practices

### Essential Project Configuration
```markdown
## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm test` - Run test suite

## Code Standards
- ES Module syntax
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode
- 80%+ test coverage

## Architecture Guidelines
- Component-based architecture
- API-first design
- Input validation required
- CSRF protection enabled

## Performance Requirements
- Core Web Vitals optimization
- Code splitting implementation
- Lazy loading for routes
```

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Bug Resolution Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Analyze
/analyze-bug "Description of the bug"
# → Creates structured GitHub issue in "Ready" column

# Step 2: Human Review (Required)
# → Review analysis and move to "To Do" manually

# Step 3: Implementation
/process-todo-queue-advanced
# → Autonomous implementation with testing
```

### 2. Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Planning
/plan-feature-comprehensive "Feature description"
# → Complete technical specification in "Ready"

# Step 2: Human Approval (Required)
# → Review architecture and approve plan

# Step 3: Implementation
/implement-complex-feature [issue-number]
# → Full feature implementation with tests
```

### 3. Code Quality Workflow
```bash
# Before coding
/tdd                    # Start with test-driven approach
/code_analysis         # Understand current codebase state

# During development
# → Write failing tests first
# → Implement minimum code to pass
# → Refactor while tests remain green

# After coding
/commit                # Create proper commit message
/create-pr            # Generate PR with description
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Agent Responsibilities
- **Analysis Agent**: Planning, research, specifications → "Ready" column
- **Implementation Agent**: Coding, testing, deployment → autonomous after approval

### Human Control Points
- **Analysis → Implementation**: Manual review and approval required
- **Emergency Stop**: Can pause any agent at any time
- **Quality Gates**: Automatic stops for critical issues

### Status Monitoring
```bash
/agent-status          # Real-time agent health dashboard
/agent-analytics       # Performance metrics
/coordinate-agents     # Inter-agent workflow orchestration
```

## Git Integration Patterns

### Branch Management
```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/[issue-number]-[short-description]

# Conventional Commits (automated by /commit)
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve mobile navigation bug
docs: update API documentation
test: add integration tests for payment flow
```

### PR Workflow (automated by /create-pr)
1. Generate comprehensive PR description
2. Include testing checklist
3. Add relevant reviewers
4. Link to related issues
5. Set appropriate labels

## Performance Optimization

### Token Management
```bash
# Environment variables for optimization
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=8192
DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS=1
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# Context optimization commands
/cost                  # Monitor token usage
/compact              # Minimize context
/clear                # Reset context between tasks
```

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Haiku**: Quick tasks, simple fixes
- **Sonnet**: Daily development work
- **Opus**: Complex refactoring, architecture decisions

## Testing Patterns

### TDD Implementation
```bash
# Red Phase: Write failing test
/tdd "Create user registration function"
# → Generates comprehensive test cases first

# Green Phase: Implement minimum code
# → Code implementation to pass tests

# Refactor Phase: Optimize while tests pass
# → Code improvements without breaking functionality
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: All functions and methods
- Integration tests: API endpoints and data flow
- E2E tests: Critical user workflows
- Minimum 80% code coverage

## Security Best Practices

### Automatic Security Implementation
- Input validation for all user inputs
- CSRF protection for forms
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection headers
- Authentication and authorization checks

### File Access Controls
```bash
# Automatically protected files
.env*
secrets/**
*.key
**/node_modules/**
```

## Docker Integration

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Container-based development
/docker-project-init           # Initialize Docker setup
/traefik-labels               # Generate reverse proxy config
/domain-config                # Configure domain setup
/nginx-spa-config            # Optimize for single-page apps
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# Production deployment
/deploy-to-production         # Automated deployment
/check-container-health       # Health verification
```

## Error Handling Patterns

### Systematic Bug Resolution
1. **Reproduce**: Create minimal reproduction case
2. **Analyze**: Identify root cause with /code_analysis
3. **Test**: Write test that exposes the bug
4. **Fix**: Implement solution that passes test
5. **Verify**: Ensure no regressions introduced

### Performance Issues
1. **Profile**: Use browser dev tools for performance analysis
2. **Identify**: Find bottlenecks in rendering or network
3. **Optimize**: Implement lazy loading, code splitting
4. **Measure**: Verify improvements with Core Web Vitals

## Team Collaboration

### Knowledge Sharing
- Document all architectural decisions in CLAUDE.md
- Use conventional commits for clear history
- Create session summaries with /project:session-start
- Share workflow patterns through pull requests

### Multi-Developer Coordination
- Use Git worktrees for parallel feature development
- Coordinate through GitHub issues and project boards
- Maintain shared CLAUDE.md for consistency
- Regular sync meetings for architecture alignment
